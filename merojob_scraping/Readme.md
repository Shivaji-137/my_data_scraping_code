# merojob_scraping_code

I have written a code for Scraping jobs in pandas dataframe from https://merojob.com/ , a forefront of connecting job seekers and employers in Nepal.

Here, pass the job you want to search for and it shows the jobs information in pandas dataframe.

All searched Resulted dataframe will have following columns:
['Company', 'Title', 'Job Category ', 'Job Level ', 'No. of Vacancy/s ',
       'Employment Type ', 'Job Location ', 'Offered Salary ',
       'Apply Before (Deadline) ', 'Education Level ', 'Experience Required ',
       'Professional Skill Required ']
